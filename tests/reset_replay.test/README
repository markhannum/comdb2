This testcase reproduces a replay case where the replay flag is incorrectly
reset to REPLAY_NONE, which causes the database to abort when it attempts to
enque something in its history after a COMMIT.  My strategy is to produce a
verify-error heavy workload which may fail on a constraint violation during
replay.
