This test verifies elect-highest-committed-gen behavior for the case where
there is no regop-gen.  In this case, each replicant should cast an old-style
vote, which only considers the end-of-log.

The test addtionally verifies behavior in a mixed cluster when an 
elect-highest-gen master writes a regop-gen record.  Election will then be
biased to only allow replicants with elect-highest-committed-gen enabled to win
an election.
